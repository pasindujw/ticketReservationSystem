# ticketReservationSystem
Tickets for a concert are to be sold through a web site. Only a limited number of tickets are available
and multiple fans may try to purchase them at the same time. Each fan can purchase up to 4 tickets
at a time. Write a server-side script to keep track of the remaining number of tickets and income
earned from tickets. No need to keep track of who purchased tickets
